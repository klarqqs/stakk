        <h2>6. Fees and Charges</h2>
        <p>Stakk may charge transaction fees, withdrawal fees, or other service-related fees. All applicable fees will be clearly disclosed before you confirm a transaction.</p>
        <p>By confirming a transaction, you agree to pay all applicable fees. Fees are non-refundable unless otherwise required by law.</p>
        <p>We may change our fee structure from time to time. Material fee changes will be communicated via in-app notification or email. Continued use after such changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
        <p>Third-party fees (e.g., network fees, bank charges) may apply and are separate from our fees.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Transaction Limits</h2>
        <p>We may set daily, monthly, or per-transaction limits based on your verification level, applicable laws, and risk assessment.</p>
        <p>Limits may be adjusted at our discretion without prior notice. Higher limits may require additional verification.</p>
        <p>We are not obligated to process transactions that exceed your limits or that we deem high-risk.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Risk Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Digital assets and blockchain transactions carry inherent risks. By using our Services, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Transactions may be irreversible once processed on the blockchain. We cannot reverse completed transactions.</li>
            <li>USDC is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, but regulatory changes, smart contract risks, or issuer issues could affect its value or availability.</li>
            <li>Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology are subject to regulatory uncertainty. Laws may change and affect our Services.</li>
            <li>We rely on third-party partners (e.g., payment processors, banks) for some services. Delays or failures by third parties may affect your transactions.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for understanding and accepting these risks.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>9. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of our Services is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>, which explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data.</p>
        <p>By using our Services, you consent to the practices described in our Privacy Notice. We encourage you to read it carefully.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content, trademarks, logos, and technology used in the Services are owned by Stakk or our licensors. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Services for lawful purposes only.</p>
        <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from our Services without our written consent.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>You may close your account at any time by contacting support. Outstanding balances must be withdrawn before closure.</p>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time if: (a) you violate these Terms; (b) we are required by regulatory authorities; (c) we deem it necessary for risk, security, or legal reasons; or (d) we discontinue the Services.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. We may retain your data as required by law.</p>
        
        <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stakk is not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages (including loss of profits, data, or goodwill).</li>
            <li>Our total liability is limited to the amount of fees you paid to us in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or NGN 100,000, whichever is less.</li>
            <li>We are not liable for delays, failures, or errors caused by third parties, blockchain networks, or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</li>
            <li>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in such cases, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Stakk, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Services, violation of these Terms, or violation of any law or third-party rights.</p>
        
        <h2>14. Governing Law and Disputes</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or the Services shall first be resolved through good-faith negotiation. If negotiation fails, disputes may be resolved through arbitration in accordance with Nigerian arbitration law, or through the competent courts of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of Nigerian courts for any legal proceedings.</p>
        
        <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time to reflect changes in law, our practices, or the Services.</p>
        <p>Material changes will be communicated via in-app notification, email, or prominent notice. We will give you at least 30 days' notice where practicable.</p>
        <p>Continued use of the Services after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Services and close your account.</p>
        
        <h2>16. General Provisions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any right does not constitute a waiver of that right.</li>
            <li><strong>Entire agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with our Privacy Notice and any other referenced policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and Stakk.</li>
        </ul>
